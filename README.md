# Magic Stack

It's a game about special cards. Those cards are part of a magic stack. Magic is a big word here.
The cards in that stack are able to bring little holograms to life as soon as those were put on a special
card device. That device will lock the card which means it was played and it's the opponent turn to make 
its next move. The game is played by two player. Each hologram is able to hit each other directly or by
its abilities. Each player has up to four cards and two activation devices. So at its max there are two cards
vs two cards. As soon as one player loses all cards he loses and the other one wins.
